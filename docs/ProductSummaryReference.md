# Product Summary Reference

_Product Summary Reference_ renders the product's reference id.

## Configuration

You should follow the usage instruction in the main [README](https://github.com/vtex-apps/product-summary/blob/master/README.md#usage).

Then, add `product-summary-reference` block into your app theme as children of `product-summary.shelf`, as we do in our [Product Summary app](https://github.com/vtex-apps/product-summary/blob/master/store/blocks.json).

```diff
     "children": [
       "product-summary-image",
       "product-summary-name",
+      "product-summary-reference",
       "product-summary-attachment-list",
       "product-summary-space",
       "product-summary-column#1"
     ]
  }
```

## Customization

In order to apply CSS customizations in this and other blocks, follow the instructions given in the recipe on [Using CSS Handles for store customization](https://vtex.io/docs/recipes/style/using-css-handles-for-store-customization).
