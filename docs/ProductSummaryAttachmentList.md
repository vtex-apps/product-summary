# Product Summary Attachment List

_Product Summary Attachment List_ renders the assembly options added and removed of an item.

## Configuration

You should follow the usage instruction in the main [README](https://github.com/vtex-apps/product-summary/blob/master/README.md#usage).

Then, add `product-summary-attachment-list` block into your app theme as children of `product-summary.shelf`, as we do in our [Product Summary app](https://github.com/vtex-apps/product-summary/blob/master/store/blocks.json).

```diff
   "product-summary.shelf": {
    "children": [
      "product-summary-image",
      "product-summary-name",
      "product-summary-sku-name",
+     "product-summary-attachment-list",
      "product-summary-space",
      "product-summary-column#1"
    ]
  },
```
